The present work aims to investigate the functional connectivity of brain networks when viewing attractive facial pictures. Despite prior research on facial attractiveness having focused on examining event-related-potentials (ERP) of EEG data, literature lacks in distinguishing the neural patterns that emerge from viewing an attractive face in comparison to a less attractive face. To perform functional connectivity analysis and graph measurements of the EEG data, a database from a prior study consisted of 23 participants was used. Firstly, the phase locking value (PLV) for the gamma frequency between each pair of electrodes was computed. Then, an exploratory data analysis of the constructed network using electrodes as nodes and PLVs as edge weights suggested complex but distinct patterns between viewing attractive and unattractive faces. The cluster-based permutation tests supported these findings, since they revealed the presence of different clusters for the two conditions. Finally, minimum spanning trees (MST) were computed for the two conditions, but no difference in graph measures (i.e., betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, tree hierarchy, modularity) were found. This work presents theoretical contributions as an initial approach towards the understanding of neural patterns response to attractive stimuli.
